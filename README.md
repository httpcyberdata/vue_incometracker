### Software versions
	NPM version: 
	Node version: 

## How to run 
1. yarn install
2. npm run start
3. Open browser to localhost & port 8080



## Problems in the project:
1. The header compoennt didn't load when returned in the setup() function so I listed the Header component under the components object.
2. The CSS done in the tutorial didn't evaluate the same in the version of Google Chrome I'm using now. So I edited the styles myself to look exactly like the tutorial.
